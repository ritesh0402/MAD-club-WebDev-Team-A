Currently studing at TSEC.
Task-1 HTML file is present in the repository with name index.html
I have made sure that the buttons on the screen react to hovering or clicking as they would do in a real website.(The buttons won't redirect you anywhere (purposely))
I was facing diffculty while finding the correct font and colors but i was unsuccessfull in findind the exact elements so please ignore that.
the images were also not that clear to understand all the paragraphs so i left those.
Rest Everything is working fine.
